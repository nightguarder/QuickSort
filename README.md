# QuickSort
Sorting algorithm with p5js

Uploaded a basic version of the Quicksort (1.3). You can test it yourself, on your local machine!

After watching the coding train tutorial I decided to code it myself.

Quick demo on the p5.js:

The algorithm sorting works as intended, but the size of array depends on your browser window size. Bigger = more data, Smaller = less data

In future version I want to add a counter for n. of operations (Big O)
and a timer for how long the algorithm runs. 

The latest version rn is 1.3!
